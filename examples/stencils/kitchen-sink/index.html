<h1>Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient</h1>
<p>The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (sometimes referred to as the PPMCC or PCC or Pearson's r) is a measure of the linear correlation (dependence) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and −1 is begin 1</p>
<p>total negativeend 1 correlation. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the degree of linear dependence between two variables. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a related idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s.</p>
<!--<p>
	Pearson's correlation coefficient when applied to a population is commonly represented by the Greek letter <script type="math/asciimath">rho</script> (rho) and may be referred to as the population correlation coefficient or the population Pearson correlation coefficient. The formula for <script type="math/asciimath">rho</script> is:

# Stencila library tools

This folder contains various software tools which may come in handy when using the Stencila platform.
These tools don't fit into any of the Stencila library packages (e.g. stencila/cpp, stencila/py) so this is their current home. The functionality they provide may eventually be integrated into the C++ package (and consequently be made available to the other packages).

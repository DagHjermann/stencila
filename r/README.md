# Stencila R package

## Build strategy

Stencila C++, and thus Stencila R, relies on numerous open source packages.
Rather than distributing the source, and hoping that the user will have all the necessary dependencies to do a compile, we
compile shared libraries (.so and .dll) files and distribute those instead.

## Build requirements

The subdirectory `requirements` has a Makefile for building the R packages required to build
this package. These are not requirements for using the Stencila R package, just for building it from source.

## Repository

Packages are built into an R package repository in the `repo` directory.
The directory structure of `repo` needs to follow [this](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Setting-up-a-package-repository)
and each terminal directory have a `PACKAGE` file which can be generated by `tools::write_PACKAGES`. 
See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2905650/creating-a-local-cran-repository) for some further clarification.

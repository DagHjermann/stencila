# Stencila R package

## Requirements

Rcpp
roxygen2

## Build strategy

Stencila C++, and thus Stencila R, relies on numerous open source packages.
Rather than distributing the source, and hoping that the user will have all the necessary dependencies to do a compile, we
compile shared libraries (.so and .dll) files and distribute those instead.

## Repository

Packages are build into an R repository in the `repo` directory.
The directory structure needs to follow [this](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Setting-up-a-package-repository)
and each terminal directory have a `PACKAGE` file which can be generated by `tools::write_PACKAGES`. 
See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2905650/creating-a-local-cran-repository) for some further clarification.

        <div data-title="">Welcome to Stencila</div>
        <p>Thanks for trying out Stencila. We're still in beta development, so it's great having people like you testing things out! Please feel free to report any bugs, or make feature suggestions, on our <a href="https://github.com/stencila/stencila" title="undefined">Github repo</a>. Or, chat with us in our <a href="https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila" title="undefined">Gitter room</a>.</p>
        <p>Stencila is the office suite for reproducible research. We're building tools for reproducible research that have the same intuitive, visual interfaces, that you and your colllegues are used to. Software that is as easy to use as Microsoft Office and Google Docs but built from the ground up to meet today's demands for data-intensive research to be transparent, reproducible and efficient.</p>
        <p>This is a Stencila Document. It's the first platform component that we've developed - Stencila Sheets (spreadsheets) and other office suite components will follow soon. So, lets look at what a Stencila Document can do and what makes it special.</p>
        <p>You can edit this document just like in a traditional word processor like Microsoft Word. We've kept the interface minimal so you can focus on authoring great content. Select some text to bring up the text toolbar. Place the cursor at the start of a paragraph or other block to change it's type e.g. paragraph to heading. Press <code>enter</code> to start a new paragraph or insert a table or cell.</p>
        <p>Cells are what makes a Stencila Document different from a traditional word processor and is what gives them there reprocibility. Cells use a very simple language called Mini to allow you to perform common data analysis and visualisation tasks within the document. As it's name suggests Mini, is a <em>minimal </em>language that is easy to both write and to read and understand.</p>
        <p>Here's a cell that reads some fictitous ice cream sales data from a CSV (comma separated values) string using the <code>csv</code> funtion,</p>
        <div data-cell="data = csv('temp,sunny,sales
18,no,23
20,yes,126
24,yes,118
23,yes,126
26,yes,280
25,no,102
20,no,93
17,no,32
18,yes,103
28,yes,246
')">
          <pre data-output="">[object Object]</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The variable <code>data</code> is a table and is now a part of of the document scope - the set of variables the document knows about. Let's filter the table to only show data for days when the temperature is less than 20 degrees,</p>
        <div data-cell="filter(data,'temp < 20')">
          <pre data-output="">[object Object]</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Notice that because we didn't assign the result of filter to a value the output get's displayed. You can change this behaviour by setting the cell's output visibility to <code>Hide</code>.</p>
        <p>Cells can also be used to plot your data. The <code>plot</code> function is a generic function that allows you to visualize data using various visual encodings,</p>
        <div data-cell="plot(data, 'points', x='temp', y='sales', color='sunny')">
          <pre data-output="">[object Object]</pre>
        </div>
        <p>When you want to combine several functions in one cell the pipe operator can produce more readable code,</p>
        <div data-cell="filtered_data = filter(data, 'temp<=25')">
          <pre data-output="">[object Object]</pre>
        </div>
        <div data-cell="filtered_data | squares(x='temp',y='sales',color='sunny') | titles(x='Temperature', y='Ice creams sold', color='Sunny day') | theme({square: {size: 120}})">
          <pre data-output="">[object Object]</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The nice thing about using Mini is that the dependency between cells can be automatically determined. So if you change the value in one cell, all the other cells that depend on tht value will automatically update - just like in a spreadsheet. Try altering the filtering expression in the <code>filtered_data</code> cell above.</p>
        <p>You can also let your readers alter document variables directly using <code>inputs</code> and inspect their value with <code>outputs</code>. Heres an example: if the diameter of a circle is <input type="range" name="diameter" min="0" max="100" step="1" value="68"></input> m then it's circumference is <span data-cell="circumference">213.52</span> m.</p>
        <div data-cell="circumference = 3.14 * diameter">
          <pre data-output="">213.52</pre>
        </div>
        <p>See <strong>Introduction to Stencila Documents</strong> for more on what you can do with Mini, including running code in other languages.</p>

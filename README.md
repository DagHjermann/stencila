##About
 
[Stencila](http://stenci.la) is a platform for doing stuff with data. 
This is an open source library for the platform. 
We're too busy coding to write much more about it than that. 
But hopefully, as the library matures, what we mean by "doing stuff" should become clear.

##Documentation

Various forms of [documentation are available](http://docs.stenci.la).
The auto-generated [documentation for the C++ library](http://docs.stenci.la/cpp/) is currently the most up to date.
The [user guide](http://docs.stenci.la/guide/intro.html) is still in a very early draft.

##Installation

Right now, the library is in a very preliminary state. 
You can download that and play with that if you like, but we don't recommend it quite yet!
If you really do want to give it a try see some of the [prerequisites](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/master/cpp/requirements)

## Testing

The Stencila [continuous integration server](http://ci.stenci.la) builds packages and run tests when commits are made to this repository.
See the C++ job for [test results](http://ci.stenci.la/job/stencila.cpp/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/%28root%29/) and [coverage reports](http://ci.stenci.la/job/stencila.cpp/lastCompletedBuild/cobertura/stencila/).

##Versioning

It is still early days so the API will change frequently. 
We are using [sematic version numbers](http://semver.org/) so versions like "0.y.z" indicate that the library is still in initial develpment phase. 
Don't rely on API stability until the release of version 1.0.0.

### About

[Stencila](http://stenci.la) is a platform for creating, collaborating on, and sharing data driven documents. The platform is made up of an ecosystem of packages. There are currently four packages that expose the platform in alternative host languages: 

- [node](https://github.com/stencila/node) : Stencila in Node.js
- [py](https://github.com/stencila/py) : Stencila in Python
- [r](https://github.com/stencila/r) : Stencila in R
- [cpp](https://github.com/stencila/cpp) : Stencila in C++

Browser based user interfaces are provided by the `web` package: 

- [web](https://github.com/stencila/web)

There is also a cross platform desktop application based on the `node` package using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)

- [electron](https://github.com/stencila/electron)

This repository doesn't contain any active code itself, it's just here as a central place for shared documentation and issues.

### Install

We're currently undertaking a major rewrite of the platform, moving to a more modular and decoupled architecture. It's still a work in progress. But see the individual packages for installation instructions.

### Discuss

We love feedback. Create a [new issue](issues/new), add to [existing issues](stencila/issues) or chat with members of the community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila).

### Develop

If you would like to help out with development, great! Please see the roadmaps and issues for each of the repos:

### Museum

As with many sotware projects, Stencila has evolved a lot as we have learned what works and what doesn't. Two independent branches have been preserved in this repo for historical interest (and because they contain a significant amount of work and some useful code!):

#### [`triassic`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/triassic) c. 2012-2013. 305 commits

#### [`jurassic`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/jurassic) c. 2014-2016. 2414 commits

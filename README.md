##About

[Stencila](http://stenci.la) is a platform for doing stuff with data.
This is the open source library for the platform.
We're too busy coding to write much more about it than that.
But, as the library matures, what we mean by "doing stuff" should become clear.

##Versioning

It is still very early days so the API will change frequently.
We are using [sematic version numbers](http://semver.org/) so versions like "0.y.z" indicate that the library is still in initial development phase.
Don't rely on API stability until the release of version 1.0.0.

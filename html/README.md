# Stencila HTML module

The HTML module of the Stencila library provides interfaces for using Stencila components in an HTML environment such as a web-browser. It is analagous to the other Stencila language interfaces (e.g. C++, Python and R interfaces) except that rather than providing an application programming interface (API) this module provides a user interface (UI) to Stencila components.

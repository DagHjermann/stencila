<div id="title">Test for math</div>

<p>Documents can include math like this, <span data-math="asciimath">E = mc^2</span>, this <span data-math="asciimath">pi</span>, or this <span data-math="asciimath">c = sqrt{a^2+b^2}</span>. We use <code>&lt;span data-math="asciimath"&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;script type="math/asciimath"&gt;</code> (used by MathJax)so that unrendered math markup is seen as content by both humans (in the case that Javscript based rendering fails) and machines (e.g. web crawlers). After all, ASCIIMath in particular can be quite legible  without needing to be rendered.</p>

<p>If you select some math the math tool will appear and you can edit the source markup. Math can be written using ASCIIMath (the default) or <span data-math="tex">T_EX</span> math markup lnguages. The math tool has a toggle for the language.</p>

<p>Math can be displayed in inline mode (the default) like this <span data-math="tex">\int_0^\infty x^2 dx</span> or in block mode which renders math centered on it's own line with some symbols made larger, like this: <span data-math="tex block">\int_0^\infty x^2 dx</span></p>

<p>Math with errors is not displayed in normal mode but is displayed in red in reveal mode: <span data-math="tex">E = mc^</span> (similar to print directives). ASCIIMath is more permissive then TeX.</p>


<p>Macros are defined for math. Use delimiting pipes | for ASCIIMath and dollars $ for TeX e.g. <code>|x^2|</code> and <code>$x^2$</code>. The regular expressions for the macros are quite strict: they require non-space characters at each end and, for TeX, no digit after the opening dollar. That allows you to write things like <code>$2 $3</code>, <code>$2,$3</code>, <code>||</code> without it being converted into math. At the moment macros search all text in a paragraph for a match so if you type in this paragraph the characters in the `code` nodes above will get converted to math.</p>

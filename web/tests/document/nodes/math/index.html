<div id="title">Test for math</div>

<p>Documents can include math like this, <script type="math/asciimath">E = mc^2</script>, this <script type="math/asciimath">pi</script>, or this <script type="math/asciimath">c = sqrt{a^2+b^2}</script>. 

<p>If you select some math the math tool will appear and you can edit the source markup. Math can be written using ASCIIMath (the default) or <script type="math/tex">T_EX</script> math markup lnguages. The math tool has a toggle for the language.</p>

<p>Math can be displayed in inline mode (the default) like this <script type="math/tex">\int_0^\infty x^2 dx</script> or in block mode which renders math centered on it's own line with some symbols made larger, like this: <script type="math/tex;display=block">\int_0^\infty x^2 dx</script></p>

<p>Math with errors is not displayed in normal mode but is displayed in red in reveal mode: <script type="math/tex">E = mc^</script> (similar to print directives). ASCIIMath is more permissive then TeX.</p>


<p>Macros are defined for math. Use delimiting pipes | for ASCIIMath and dollars $ for TeX e.g. <code>|x^2|</code> and <code>$x^2$</code>. The regular expressions for the macros are quite strict: they require non-space characters at each end and, for TeX, no digit after the opening dollar. That allows you to write things like <code>$2 $3</code>, <code>$2,$3</code>, <code>||</code> without it being converted into math. At the moment macros search all text in a paragraph for a match so if you type in this paragraph the characters in the `code` nodes above will get converted to math.

This guide really is "under construction". As the Stencila library's API stabilises down we'll be adding more. But at the moment, as you can see, it's pretty minimal.

<h1>About this guide</h1>

<p>
This guide is part of the suite of Stencila documentation
Other documentation for the platform includes:
<ul>
	<li><a href="">the C++ API (application programming interface)</a></li>
	<li><a href="">the R package description</a></li>
</ul>
This guide aims to provide a more gentle introduction to the Stencila platform.
It makes liberal use of code examples and, usually, each code example is given for each of the languages supported by the platform.
For example, here is code snipped that simply creates and saves a Stencila Dataset:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<script class="cpp">
Dataset ds;
ds.save("test.sds");
	</script>
	<script class="py">
ds = Dataset()
ds.save("test.sds")
	</script>
	<script class="r">
ds = Dataset()
ds$save("test.sds")
	</script>
</div>

This documentation is generated for every commit to the repository and those code snippets are run against the latest version of the
language package. 

When a snippet of code produces output, for example using a "print" statement, the output appears below the
code. e.g.

<div class="code">
	<script class="py">
tuple = ('a',42)
list = ["alpha","beta"]
dict = {}
print tuple, list, dict;
	</script>
</div>

The C++ equivaluent of "print" is "std::cout". But std::cout does not by default providfe for output of standard library
classes likes vectors and maps. To provide for "pretty printing" these classes Stencila provides its own "print" for C++
which allows for Python like output.
<div class="code">
	<script class="cpp">
auto tuple = std::make_tuple('a',42);
std::vector<std::string> vector = {"alpha","beta"};
std::map<std::string,int> map = {};
print<<tuple<<vector<<map<<$;
	</script>
</div>
